DynDns
========



If you have a HUAWEI HG8245(C), HG8045H, HG8346M router or any other HUAWEI routers that have 'dyndns-custom' in the 'Service Provider' list, you may use the 'dyndns-custom' option to set up dynamic DNS service. Many users provided feedback that the GnuDIP protocol in these routers does not work as expected and the best option is 'DynDNS-custom'....

From the main menu, select Advanced then DDNS . Use the following settings: 

* Service Provider : dyndns-custom

* WAN Connection : nas_0_38

* Host Name : api.dynu.com

* Server port : 8245 or 80

* Domain Name : If you have a Dynu subdomain yourdomain.dynu.com, enter yourdomain.dynu.com . If you have your own domain name yourdomain.com, use yourdomain.com .

* User name : your Dynu username

* Password : your Dynu password, IP update password or MD5/SHA256 encrypted password


If you still have questions on the configuration, you may refer to the API page or contact support.
